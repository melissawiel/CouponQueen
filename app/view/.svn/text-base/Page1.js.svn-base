Synesthesia is the perceptual condition of mixed sensations—synesthetes may experience musical notes as having an inherent color or words as producing perceptible flavors. Nabokov experienced color-grapheme synesthesia, a variety of the condition in which letters were associated with specific colors. In his memoir, Speak, Memory, and in interviews, Nabokov described his experience with synesthia, describing a “huckleberry” h and a “light blue” c.
